It is the project of Machine learning.
The system is designed for classifying Parkinson's Disease.


Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease. Damage or death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain can lead to severe motor and cognitive impairment. In order to achieve the prediction, diagnosis and monitoring of this disease, we use a variety of machine learning methods to analyze the voice recording data sets of Parkinson's disease patients and control group, so as to make a reasonable prediction of Parkinson's disease. Our focus is on assessing the most efficient feature groups and prediction classifiers. Thus, patients and healthy people can be distinguished. We used ensemble models, feeding all the feature subsets and the parameters are optimized. The results show that the best accuracy can reach 0.75, best f1 score can be 0.72 and best recall score can be 0.72.

Data Set Information:

The data used in this study were gathered from 188 patients with PD (107 men and 81 women) with ages ranging from 33 to 87 (65.1Â±10.9) at the Department of Neurology in CerrahpaÅŸa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. The control group consists of 64 healthy individuals (23 men and 41 women) with ages varying between 41 and 82 (61.1Â±8.9). During the data collection process, the microphone is set to 44.1 KHz and following the physicianâ€™s examination, the sustained phonation of the vowel /a/ was collected from each subject with three repetitions.


Attribute Information:

Various speech signal processing algorithms including Time Frequency Features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Wavelet Transform based Features, Vocal Fold Features and TWQT features have been applied to the speech recordings of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients to extract clinically useful information for PD assessment.
